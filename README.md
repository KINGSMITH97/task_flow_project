# Task Flow Project

A mobile app to demonstrate my flutter mobile application skills. This is a fictional app with the following features:
* Users should be able to sign up if they are new and sign in if they have an account.
* Users should be able to skip sign up and sign in if they don't want to create an account
* Users should be able to see their tasks created on the home screen when the app opens
* Users should be able to create, delete and update a task (should be done on a full screen - not dialog or bottom sheet)
* A task should have the following properties - title(required), description(optional), time created(required - automatic), completion date and time(optional), priority(required - default to low)
* Users should be able to see an analytics of task created, completed and abandoned over a period of time (day, week,month and year)
